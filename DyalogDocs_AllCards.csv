"The symbol chosen to represent Mix depends on the current Migration Level. <br/> If ‚éēML<2, Mix is represented by the symbol: ‚ÜĎ. <br/> If ‚éēML‚Č•2, Mix is represented by the symbol: ‚äÉ. <br/> Y may be any array whose items may be uniform in rank and shape, or differ in rank and shape. If the items of Y are non-uniform, they are extended prior to the application of the function as follows: <br/> For the purposes of the following narrative,  y represents the virtual item in Y with the greatest rank and shape, with which all other items are extended to conform. <br/> R is an array composed from the items of  Y assembled into a higher-rank array with one less level of nesting. ‚ćīR will be some permutation of (‚ćīY),‚ćīy. <br/> K is an optional axis specification whose value(s)  indicate where in the result the axes of y appear. There are three cases: <br/> If K is absent, the axes of y appear as the last axes of the result. <br/> In this example, the shape of Y is 3, and the shape of  y is 2. So the shape of the result will be a permutation of 2 and 3, i.e. in this simple example, either (2 3) or (3 2). <br/> If K is omitted, the shape of the result is (‚ćīY),‚ćīy. <br/> If K is between 0 and 1, the shape of the result is (‚ćīy),‚ćīY because (‚ćīy) is inserted between the 0th and the 1st axis of the result, i.e. at the beginning. <br/> If K is between 1 and 2, the shape of the result is (‚ćīY),‚ćīy because (‚ćīy) is inserted between the 1st and 2nd axis of the result, i.e. at the end. This is the same as the case when K is omitted. <br/> An integer K may be used instead. If ‚éēML‚Č•2,  ‚äÉ is used instead of ‚ÜĎ). <br/> If the items of Y are unequal in shape, the shorter ones are extended: <br/> Notice that in the last statement, the shape of the third item was extended by catenating it with its prototype. <br/> In the following examples, Y is a matrix of shape (5 4) and each item of Y (y) is a matrix of shape (3 2). The shape of the result will be some permutation of (5 4 3 2). <br/> By default, the axes of y appear in the last position in the shape of the result, but this position is altered by specifying the axis K. Notice where the (3 2) appears in the following results: <br/> Note that ‚äÉ[4]Y generates an INDEX ERROR because 4 is greater than the length of the result. <br/>  The axes of y do not have to be contiguous in the shape of the result. By specifying a vector K, they can be distributed. Notice where the 3 and the 2 appear in the following results: <br/> If the items of Y are unequal in rank, the lower rank items are extended in rank by prefixing their shapes with 1s. Each additional 1 may then be increased to match the maximum shape of the other items along that axis. <br/> In the above example, the first item (1) becomes (1 1‚ćī1) to conform with the 3rd item which is rank 2. It is then extended in shape to become (2 4‚ÜĎ1 1‚ćī1) to conform with the 2-row 3rd item, and 4-column 2nd item..

"Assignment  allocates the result of the expression Y to the name or names in X. <br/> If Y is an array expression, X must contain one or more names which are variables, system variables, or are undefined. Following assignment, the name(s) in X become variable(s) with value(s) taken from the result of the expression Y. <br/> If X contains a single name, the variable assumes the value of Y. If X contains multiple names then Y can be a single-item array of any rank (including a scalar) or  a vector. If Y is a single-item array, the scalar value ⊃Y is assigned to all names in X. Otherwise, each element of Y is assigned to the corresponding name in X.  Although not mandatory, Dyalog recommends that the names in X are enclosed in parentheses to reduce potential ambiguity in assignment statements. <br/> The assignment arrow (or specification arrow) is often read as 'Is' or 'Gets'. <br/> Implementation note: erroneous expressions such as var 3←5 will result in 5 being assigned to var, even though a SYNTAX ERROR will be generated. In the case of (var 3)←5 no assignment will be made. <br/>  Pass-through assignments are permitted. The value of Y is carried through each assignment: <br/> If Y is a function expression, X must be a single name which is either undefined, or is the name of an existing function or defined operator. X may not be the name of a system function, or a primitive symbol. <br/> If an expression evaluates to a namespace reference, or ref, you may assign it to a name. A name assigned to a simple scalar ref, has name class 9, whereas one assigned to an array containing refs has name class 2. <br/> A name that already exists may be assigned a new value if the assignment will not alter its name class, or will change it from 2 to 9 or vice versa.

Assignment<br/><br/>What does this glyph do?,"Assignment  allocates the result of the expression Y to the name or names in X. <br/> If Y is an array expression, X must contain one or more names which are variables, system variables, or are undefined.

"Classic Edition: the symbol ⌺ is not available in Classic Edition, and the Stencil operator is instead represented by ⎕U233A. <br/> Stencil is used in image processing, artificial neural networks, computational fluid dynamics, cellular automata, and many other fields of application. The computation is sometimes referred to as tessellation, moving window, or stencil code. This operator applies the left operand function f to a series of (possibly overlapping) rectangles in the array Y. <br/> In general, the right operand g is a 2- row matrix of positive non-zero integers with up to ⍴⍴Y columns. The first row contains the rectangle sizes, the second row the movements i.e. how much to move the rectangle in each step. If g is a scalar or vector it specifies the rectangle size and the movement defaults to 1. <br/> The predominant case uses a rectangle size which is odd and a movement of 1. <br/> Rectangles are centred on successive elements of Y and (unless the rectangle size is 1), padded with fill elements. <br/> The first rectangle is centred on the first element of Y preceded by the appropriate number of fill elements. Subsequent rectangles are centred on subsequent elements of Y according to the size of the movement, and padded before or after as appropriate. When the movement is 1, each element of Y in its turn is the middle of a rectangle. <br/> f is invoked dyadically with a vector left argument indicating for each axis the number of fill elements and on what side; positive values mean that the padding precedes the array values,
negative values mean that the padding follows the array values. <br/> In the first expression above, the left operand function {⊂⍺ ⍵} simply displays its left and right arguments to illustrate the mechanics of the operation. The right operand (3 3) specifies that each rectangle contains 3 rows and 3 columns, and the movement is 1.  <br/> In order for the first element of Y (1) to be centred, the first rectangle is padded with a row above and a column to the left, as indicated by the left argument (1 1) to the function. <br/> Another way to think about the way Stencil operates is that it portions the array into sections or neighbourhoods in which elements can be analysed with respect to their immediate neighbours.
