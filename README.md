# Anki

This repo is to hold stuff for my Anki repetitive spaced learning decks.  Currently I only have decks created for Dyalog APL, though it may or may not host other stuff in the future.

# Files

+ **DyalogAnki.ipynb:** Creates several importable anki decks for dyalog APL
    + **AplStudyGroup_CodeCards.csv:** This is an Anki importable deck
        + Contains cards auto generated from notebooks created as part of the [fastai apl study group](https://fastai.github.io/apl-study).  These cards give a simple code snippet and your job is to predict the output
     + **DyalogDocs_AllCards.csv:** This is an Anki importable deck
        + Contains cards auto generated by scraping the Dyalog Docs.
        + Symbol -> Symbol Name, Symbol Name -> Symbol, Symbol Name -> What it does, What is does -> Symbol, etc.
