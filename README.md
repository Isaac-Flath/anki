# Anki

This repo is to hold stuff for my Anki repetitive spaced learning decks.  Currently I only have decks created for Dyalog APL, though it may or may not host other stuff in the future.

# Fastai APL Study Group Instructions

If you are following the [fastai apl-study group](https://forums.fast.ai/t/apl-array-programming/97188) follow these instructions.  These will allow cards to be added as you follow along in the course.

+ Load the `AplStudyGroup_CodeCards_Sessions<num>.csv` deck after each session you watch.  This has all the cards covered up to the session of the fastai apl study group.  Unfortunately I do not have sessions 1 - 3 broken out (they are included in Session4) but please submit a PR for that if you'd like!
+ Be sure the following options are selected when you Import the Deck:
    + `Deck` is named "APL Study Group" (Or whatever sensible name you'd like)
    + `Update Existing notes when first field matches` is selected in the drop down
    + `Allow HTML in fields` Should be checked
