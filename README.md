# Anki

This repo is to hold stuff for my Anki repetitive spaced learning decks I have created.  Currently I only have decks created for Dyalog APL, though it may or may not host other stuff in the future.

For any uploads **Allow HTML in fields must be checked**.  It's not checked by default, so do look at it.
