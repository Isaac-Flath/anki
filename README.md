# Anki

This repo is to hold stuff for my Anki repetitive spaced learning decks.  Currently I only have decks created for Dyalog APL, though it may or may not host other stuff in the future.

# Fastai APL Study Group Instructions

If you are following the [fastai apl-study group](https://forums.fast.ai/t/apl-array-programming/97188) either live or following the pre-recorded sessions.

1. Load the `AplStudyGroup_CodeCards_Week1.csv` deck.  This has all the cards covered in week 1 of the fastai apl study group.
1. After watching each study group session check back to load any new decks.  They will be named `AplStudyGroup_CodeCards_Session<num>diff.csv`.  This will create a deck with any cards that have either changed or created based on the latest changes.  For example `AplStudyGroup_CodeCards_Session5diff.csv` will have only cards modified or added during Session 5 of the study group.
